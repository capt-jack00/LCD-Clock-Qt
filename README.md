# LCD Clock App 
This is simple app that displays current time on LCD looking like clock. This is another small project that helps me with my 
journey learning developing software. This clock fetches your local time from your system and displays it in application. Nothing special.
# Compatibility
It works on Linux, but I don't know how about other OS like MAC or Windows
# Installation and use 
Soon...
